## Recommended System Requirements
Cuties is a cross-platform application. It is supported on a variety of 32-bit and 64-bit platforms. 

### Hardware platform
- Intel® Pentium™ III M processor or better.
- 64MB of RAM or better(DDR or better recommended).
- Intel GMA X4500 / nVIDIA GeForce3 Ti500 / ATI Radeon 9100 or better.
- 60 MB of disk space. You need more disk space to store compilers.

### Operating system
You should using one of the following operating system:

- Microsoft® Windows® XP Service Pack 2 or later, both 32-bit and 64-bit.
- Apple® Mac OS X Lion 10.7 or later, 64-bit. 
- Linux/X11, 64-bit.

## Building Prerequisites

Cuties requires that various tools and packages be available for use in the build procedure. Modifying Cuties sources requires additional tools described below.

If you think the following step is too advanced or too tedious, we provide you a [Quick preparing guide](https://github.com/Kreogist/Cuties/wiki/Quick-preparing-guide). And you can skip to Downloading the source.

### Tools/packages necessary for building Cuties

* **Qt 5.1.1 libraries or above**

You should have 5.1.1 or later version of Qt. We suggest you to use Qt 5.2 to build Cuties.

Please **DO NOT** use Qt 5.1, there're several bugs in Qt 5.1 and it works really bad on Mac OS X. But Qt 5.1.1 works really nice.

* **Compilers on your own system**

You should have a compiler for your own operating system. 

For Windows, we suggest you to use MinGW GNU Compiler Collections (MinGW GCC). You can get it from the [homepage](http://gcc.gnu.org/) of GCC. If you hope that you don't have to worry about the compilers, we suggest you to download binary package 'Qt 5.2.0 for Windows 32-bit' on Qt Project [download page](http://qt-project.org/downloads).

For Mac OS X, we suggest you to use XCode with command line tools. You can get it from the Mac App Store, and you can get Command Line Tools from Apple Developer. You can access [Downloads](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/) on Apple Developer to get a command line tools for XCode 5.0. We find out that command line tools will not provided any more on the XCode 5.0.

For Ubuntu Linux or other Linux user, you should provide your own compilers. You need `g++` and `gcc` to build Cuties for essential need.

If you have trouble with set up Qt, please visit [Download Qt](http://qt-project.org/downloads) for binary packages, [Getting Started with Qt](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/gettingstarted.html) for Downloading and Installing Qt guide.

### Tools/packages additional for building Cuties

* **Qt Creator 2.7 or above**

You may need a Qt Creator to do make and build for you instead of doing them by yourself. We suggest you to build Cuties with Qt Creator.

For Qt 5.1.1, we suggest you to use Qt Creator 2.7.2. For Qt 5.2, we suggest you to use Qt Creator 3.0. For more details about Qt Creator, please visit [Qt Project](http://qt-project.org/).

* **Qt Linguist**

You may need Qt Linguist to release a translation file, or you have to release translation files by `lupdate` and `lrelease`. 

* **CMake**

We are know currently working on build Cuties for CMake. You can use CMake instead of qmake to build Cuties if you like to.

### Tools/packages necessary for modifying Cuties

* **A code editor or an IDE**

To modifying Cuties code, you should have a code editor - like Notepad in Windows, though we all don't like to use it :) - or an IDE - like Qt Creator.

So, we really suggest you to download the full package of Qt 5.1.1 or above. You can find Qt Creator and Qt Linguist on http://qt-project.org. We suggest you to download a binary package which includes Qt libraries and Qt Creator from http://qt-project.org/downloads.

### Tips from Kreogist
* **The version of Qt we used to build Cuties**

We build Cuties on Windows Platform via Qt 5.2.0 for Android (Windows 32-bit, 761 MB), on Mac OS X Platform via Qt 5.2.0 for Android and iOS (Mac, 1.0 GB), and on Linux via Qt 5.1.1 for Linux 64-bit (415 MB).

* **Set environment variables**

This is really important. For Windows and Mac OS X users.

* Windows

If you are using windows, add the path of Qt to your system environment variables %PATH%. It should be like a path below:

    D:\Qt\Qt5.2.0\5.2.0\mingw48_32\bin

And you have to add MinGW compiler path to your system environment variables %PATH%. To learn more about system environment varibables, please visit [Environment variable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#Microsoft_Windows) on Wikipedia. To learn more about how to set system environment variable on Windows, please visit [User Environment Variables](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb776899%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) from Microsoft Dev Center - Desktop.

* Mac OS X

You should know the basic operate of vi or any text editor you'd like to use. To learn the basic operate of vi, please visit [Vim documentation: help](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/help.html) for moving the text cursor, text insert and file saving in vi. These means are the same in both vi and vim.

Launch your terminal, input:

    sudo vi /etc/paths

and input your password to launch `vi` editor to edit `path` file. You should check whether the Qt directory is in the file. It should be like a path below:

    /Applications/Qt5.2.0/5.2.0/clang_64/

There should have some other paths there, like `/usr/bin`, `/bin`, `/usr/sbin`, `/sbin` and `/usr/local/bin`.

## Building

Here we will use Qt Creator to build Cuties. We will show you how to build Cuties on Windows, Mac OS X and Ubuntu Linux.

Launch Qt Creator and open the `Kreogist-Cuties.pro` in `src` folder. 

Select kit Release > app for the project. Choose Build > Build Project or press Ctrl+B to build Cuties. Wait for it finished.

Select kit Release > ConsoleRunner. And Choose Build > Build Project or press Ctrl+B to build command line application executor. Wait for it finished.

Launch Linguist, open `translations` folder in the `app` folder. Open the language file you want in Linguist, release the .qm file wherever you can easily find. Open `image` folder then open `Locale`. Rename the .qm file to the corresponding .png file's name. 

### Windows

Open your build directory in your file browser. You can find `app` directory, `tools` directory and `Makefile` file. Open `tools` folder, there will be only one folder named `ConsoleRunner`. Open ConsoleRunner folder. You will find several folders and files:

	debug                  <Directory>
	release                <Directory>
	Makefile               <File>
	Makefile.Debug         <File>
	Makefile.Release       <File>

Open release folder, you will find a binary file `KciConsoleRunner.exe`, others will be `KciConsoleRunner`. Copy this file to directory `(You build directory)/app/release`.

Then switch to the `src` folder which contains `Kreogist-Cuties.pro`, open `app` folder and `default_settings` folder, copy file `default.style` and `DefaultColorConfig.ini` file to the directory `(You build directory)/app/release`. These two files are color configure file.

The copy the following files to the directory `(You build directory)/app/release`:

International Components for Unicode(ICU) Libraries:

    icudt51.dll
    icuin51.dll
    icuuc51.dll

For MinGW compiler, C/C++ runtime libraries.

    libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
    libstdc++-6.dll
    libwinpthread-1.dll

Qt 5 Libraries:

    Qt5Core.dll
    Qt5Gui.dll
    Qt5Network.dll
    Qt5Widgets.dll

Now, try to launch Cuties.exe, It should can be used.

### Mac OS X

Open your build directory in your file browser. You can find `app` and `tools` in the folder, open `tools` folder. There should be only one folder named `ConsoleRunner`. Open `ConsoleRunner` and copy executable file `KciConsoleRunner`.

Back to `Release` Folder, open `app` folder. There's a folder `Cuties.app`, right click `Cuties.app` and select `Show Package Contents`. Then open `Contents` and `MacOS` folder. 
 
Then switch to the `src` folder which contains `Kreogist-Cuties.pro`, open `app` folder and `default_settings` folder, copy file `default.style` and `DefaultColorConfig.ini` file to the directory `(You build directory)/app/Cuties.app/Contents/MacOS/`. These two files are color configure file.

Copy `openTerminal.command` from `mac_terminal` folder to `(You build directory)/app/Cuties.app/Contents/MacOS/`.

Make a folder named `Locale`, copy `Locale` folder in the `image` folder from the source code directory to the new `Locale` folder. Now there should have a language database file `Locale.db` and several .png image files. Copy those .qm files to the new `Locale` folder.

##Install

Currently, Cuties is still don't have a unintaller or setup program. Cuties won't write any other values to system. So if you wan't to remove Cuties, just delete it.
